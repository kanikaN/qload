        <p>Qyuki is a platform where members can showcase their talent in the various creative areas that the Qyuki website (the <b>"Website"</b>) offers. As the Website allows members to upload their creations or display their talent online, most of the content available on the Website is user generated content. Due to the nature of the content, and the large Qyuki community, it is not possible for Qyuki to monitor all content that is made available on the Website. </p>
        <p>As members of the Qyuki community, you have certain responsibilities to yourselves and to each other. You are requested to "report abuse" with respect to content that you find questionable or offensive or in any manner violative of Qyuki's policies. </p>
        <p>Qyuki requests its members to adhere to its policies and report instants of abuse to Qyuki in all such cases, including those mentioned below:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <li><p><b> Hate speech:</b> Qyuki does not tolerate hate speech. Please grant each other mutual respect when you communicate here. While discussion and exchange of ideas should be encouraged, Qyuki does not encourage distinguishing individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or disease. Hate speech includes debasing or dehumanizing language and incitement of violence or prejudicial action against an individual or group of people based on their affiliation. You are required not to indulge in such behavior and to bring such behavior by other members to the attention of Qyuki.</p></li>
            <li><p> <b>Sex and Nudity: </b>Qyuki does not encourage nudity or pornography. The services provided by the Website are not intended to create, possess or distribute any obscene or pornographic material. Before posting debatable or questionable content, be mindful of its consequences. Do not publish sexually explicit images or videos, such as those with nudity or graphic sex acts. </li.
            <li><p><b>Malicious Content: </b>Do not post content the sole purpose of which is to defame someone or injure or malign someone's reputation by making malicious personal attacks without any political, professional or social commentary.</li.
            <li><p> <b>Threats:</b> Qyuki want its members to feel safe on the Website. Do not use threatening language or otherwise post threats on this Website. </p></li>

            <li><p> <b>Privacy and Identity: </b>Qyuki is a community that encourages talent and gives such talent a platform, exposure and viewership. Qyuki also provides guidance to talented individuals, by way of mentor guidance. It is therefore, a platform where creative people connect and share using their real identities. When you represent yourself accurately on the Website, you are helping to build trust and safety for everyone. Identify theft, creating multiple accounts, or falsely representing an organization undermines this trust. Therefore, please provide correct and true information about yourself when creating an account on the Website or while interacting with mentors or other individuals on the Website. Also abstain from publishing other people's personal information. You can use parody or satire to make a point, but be sure that you aren't misleading others about your true identity. </p></li>
            <li><p> <b>Personal and Confidential Information:</b> Qyuki does not encourage unauthorized publishing of people's private and confidential information, such as credit card numbers, driver's and other license numbers, or any other information that is not publicly accessible. You are required to desist from the same.</p></li>
            <li><p> <b>Phishing, Spam and Malware:</b> Do not upload or share any content with malware, viruses, or anything that may disrupt the services on the Website or harm others. Do not engage in password phishing, spamming other members of the community or using automated means to perform actions such as creating new profiles, sending messages, creating new communities, etc.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>On receiving a complaint on any of the above grounds, the measures that Qyuki may take include:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <li><p> Removing the material;</p></li>
            <li><p> Restricting access to that content by limiting who can view the content, such as through a warning page prior to viewing the material;</p></li> 
            <li><p>Deleting the user's Qyuki Account; or</p></li>
            <li><p> Reporting the violation to appropriate law enforcement authorities.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may disagree with certain material or find it to be inappropriate. However, Qyuki understands that users have many different points of view. Qyuki takes this into consideration when reviewing reports of abuse and may make exceptions based on artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific considerations or where there are other substantial benefits to the public from not taking action on the content. Although not all reports will result in action, Qyuki does rely on the users to identify and report material that may be violating Qyuki's policies. So please continue keeping Qyuki informed of any potential abuse.</p>
